# Tax Revenue Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict tax revenues for the fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 in Lesotho. The model utilizes historical data on tax revenues, personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains-tax rates, and other relevant features to make predictions. The ultimate goal is to assist Revenue Services Lesotho (RSL) in making informed decisions for planning and budgeting processes, thus contributing to Lesotho's economic stability.

## Accuracy

The model achieved an average Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3000.22 and an average R-squared score of 0.9673 during the initial evaluation using K-Fold Cross-Validation. After parameter tuning, the optimized model obtained an MSE of 4456.61 and an R-squared score of 0.9503 when assessed on the test set.
